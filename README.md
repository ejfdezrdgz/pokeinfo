# PokéInfo Encyclopedia
Welcome to PokéInfo's GitHub page. This is a one-man project aiming to improve my coding skills in JS (as well as CSS and HTML), while also trying to make a useful tool for quickly getting information about all released Pokémon under [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Goals
- First and foremost, learn and improve my coding
- **NOT** to use any external modules or scripts (aside from [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next), because I can't be bothered to make a full translation module myself)
- Provide a clean, powerful and straightforward way to search for Pokémon across all generations

## To do
A goddamn lot. Given the utter amount of info there is about the Pokémon universe, this list could be almost virtually infinite.

If I had to say something, I'd say completely localized stats, evolution trees, descriptions and such for each and every Pokémon in the wild. That's the least it would have to have for it to come "out of beta".

There's a very high chance it's going to be eternally a WIP, because even if I end up finish the Pokémon side of things, there's always going to be moves, maps, items, berries, trainers and whatever to be implemented. So don't expect it to be completely "done". **EVER**.

## Other information
I'm totally open to suggestions and/or complaints regarding a feature, style or translation (this last one even more so than the others, because I made my own dictionaries for this and, for example, I can't speak a word of German).
